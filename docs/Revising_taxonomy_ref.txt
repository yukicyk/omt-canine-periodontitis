Using RDP instead of silva trainset.... The use of superphylum patescibacteria in silva database is incompatible with the NCBI and HOMD databases; and it collated all the candidate phyla data together.


There are duplicated taxa starting at phylum levels or mixture of different taxonomy becoz the different database use different name (e.g "Absconditabacteria (SR1)" and "SR1" at the phylum rank; and "Absconditabacteria (SR1)" at order rank under "Patescibacteria" > "Gracilibacteria"

Patescibacteria (source wikipedia)
The proposed superphylum, Patescibacteria, includes candidate phyla Gracilibacteria, Microgenomates, Parcubacteria, and Saccharibacteria[44][46] and possibly Dependentiae.[48] These same candidate phyla, along with candidate phyla Berkelbacteria, CPR2, CPR3, Kazan, Perigrinibacteria, SM2F11, WS6, and WWE3 were more recently proposed to belong to the larger CPR Group.[47] To complicate matters, it has been suggested that several of these phyla are themselves actually superphyla (see the section on cryptic superphyla below).
