Introduction: State the main research questions. What were you trying to find out from the data?
A Section for Each Key Step/Challenge: Instead of just following the scripts, structure it around the analytical challenges.
"The Journey to a Clean Phyloseq Object (Scripts 00-02)": Explain why a custom taxonomy database was needed. Mention any pitfalls during DADA2 (e.g., deciding on truncation lengths).
"First Look at the Data: Ordination and PERMANOVA (Script 03)": Explain why you chose Bray-Curtis and UniFrac. Describe what the first PCoA plots told you and how PERMANOVA confirmed the visual patterns.
"The Problem with Simple Correlations (Script 04)": This is a perfect place to be transparent.
Initial Approach: "My first attempt was to run a standard Pearson correlation between all ASVs and clinical parameters."
The Flaw: "I quickly realized this produced hundreds of p-values, and without correction for multiple comparisons, many of these 'significant' results were likely false positives."
The Solution: "The workflow was therefore patched to use a method that adjusts p-values (e.g., from the Hmisc package), providing a much more robust and trustworthy set of correlations."
"Why Random Forest?": Explain that while correlation shows association, you wanted to see if you could build a model that predicts clinical outcomes from the microbiome, which is a different and more powerful question.
"For Fun and Insight: The Animated Plots (Script 06)": Explicitly state that this was an exploratory analysis. "While not included in the final publication, these animated plots were created to provide a more intuitive, dynamic view of how each dog's microbiome shifted over time. They were invaluable for building intuition about the data."
Conclusion: Briefly summarize the key analytical decisions and how the final workflow is a product of this iterative and careful process.
